# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Prediction

Cervical cancer kills about 300 000 women worldwide. 
The dataset was found on UCI under the name [Cervical cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29#) which was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela.

Here we build and train an XGBoost model to predict cervical cancer in 858 patients by considering their demographic information, habits and historic medical records.
