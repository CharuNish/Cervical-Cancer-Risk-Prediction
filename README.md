# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting cervical cancer using the XGBoost algorithm. Cervical cancer is a significant public health problem, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.

## Project Overview
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at high risk of cervical cancer based on their health information.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project comprises various health metrics that are potential indicators of cervical cancer. Key features include demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and previous medical examination results. Each data point corresponds to an individual's health record, with labels indicating the presence or absence of cervical cancer.

### Key Features
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol use, etc.)
- Medical history (number of pregnancies, use of contraceptives, etc.)
- Results of previous medical examinations

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model is trained and evaluated on separate data instances, preventing overfitting and ensuring the model's generalizability.

## Model Description
The XGBoost algorithm was chosen for its effectiveness in handling tabular data, its efficiency, and its ability to deal with various types of features. XGBoost stands out for its speed and performance, primarily due to its implementation of gradient boosting, which optimizes both the model's accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Training Process
The model training involved:
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature selection to identify the most relevant features for predicting cervical cancer.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
- Cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## Results
The XGBoost model demonstrated promising results in predicting cervical cancer:
- Accuracy: 95.3%
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: 0.96,0.95,0.96

These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in identifying potential cervical cancer cases, making it a valuable tool for early detection and intervention.

## Conclusion
The use of the XGBoost algorithm in predicting cervical cancer showcases the potential of machine learning in enhancing healthcare outcomes. By accurately identifying at-risk individuals, this model can contribute to early detection efforts, ultimately leading to timely treatment and improved survival rates.
